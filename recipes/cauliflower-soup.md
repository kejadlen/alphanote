## [Creamy Cauliflower and Bacon Soup Recipe][source]

[source]: https://www.seriouseats.com/creamy-cauliflower-bacon-soup-recipe

- Yield: 4
- Active time: 20 mins
- Total time: 45 mins

### Ingredients

- 1/2 pound sliced bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)
- 6 scallions, white and pale green parts only, thinly sliced
- 4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1 quart homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock, plus more as
  needed
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 cup half &amp; half or heavy cream
- 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Directions

1. Heat bacon in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, stirring constantly
   until bacon is completely crisp. Remove from Dutch oven with a slotted spoon
   and set aside, leaving the fat in the dutch oven.

1. Add onions, half of scallions, and garlic, and cook, stirring constantly and
   scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan until onion is softened,
   about 5 minutes.

1. Add chicken stock, bay leaves, half &amp; half (or cream), and cauliflower.
   Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until cauliflower is
   completely tender, about 30 minutes,

1. Working in batches, blend soup until completely smooth (if you don't have a
   very powerful blender, remove the bay leaf before blending. If an
   extra-smooth soup is desired, pass the soup through a fine mesh strainer
   after blending); if soup is too thick, whisk in additional hot chicken
   stock, 1/2 cup at a time, until you've reached the desired consistency.
   Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve sprinkled with crisp bacon
   pieces and remaining scallions.
