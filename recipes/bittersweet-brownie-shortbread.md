## 2021.05.30

These were a hit! Probably could've let the shortbread go a little longer, and
they tasted better the next day.

- Yield: 32 bars
- Active time: N/A
- Total time: 32 bars

### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups/340 grams cold unsalted butter (3 sticks), cut into 1/2-inch
  pieces, plus more for greasing the pan
- 3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar
- 1 1/4 teaspoons fine sea salt
- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter (2 1/4 sticks)
- 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 1 1/4 cups/265 grams light brown sugar
- 1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon/45 grams cocoa powder
- 3 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 3/4 cup/90 grams slivered almonds, chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)
- Flaky sea salt

### Directions

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, and line with
   parchment paper so that there is a 2-inch overhang on the two long sides.

1. Prepare the shortbread: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
   paddle attachment or beaters, mix together flour, sugar and salt. Beat in
   butter on low speed until dough just comes together but is still a little
   crumbly. (Or pulse together ingredients in a food processor.)

1. Press dough into prepared pan. Prick dough all over with a fork. Bake until
   golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven. Raise oven temperature to 375
   degrees.

1. As shortbread bakes, prepare the brownie: Place butter and chocolate in a
   large bowl. Melt in the microwave in 30-second bursts, stirring after each
   burst, until smooth. (Alternatively, place bowl over a pot of simmering
   water, and heat chocolate and butter, stirring until smooth and melted.)
   Whisk in sugars and cocoa powder until smooth, then whisk in eggs and
   vanilla.

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour and sea salt. Whisk into chocolate
   mixture until no streaks of flour remain. Fold in nuts, if using. Spread
   mixture onto the warm shortbread base. Sprinkle lightly but evenly with
   flaky sea salt.

1. Bake until the top is set, the center is soft, and the edges start pulling
   away from the pan, 23 to 28 minutes. (A toothpick inserted into the center
   will come out gooey.) Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Cut into
   bars before serving.
