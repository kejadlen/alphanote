# Fried Chicken

## 2021.02.05 - (Pollo Campero)[pollo-campero]

- Didn't have seasoning salt, so replaced with just normal salt, but this was
  far too salty. Probably 5-10g of salt would've been a more suitable
  replacement.
- Pretty good, but liked normal fried chicken a bit more.

## [Homemade Pollo Campero (Central American-Style Fried Chicken) Recipe][pollo-campero]

[pollo-campero]: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2021/01/pollo-campero-fried-chicken.html

- Yield: Serves 4
- Active time: 1 hour 30 minutes
- Total time: 1 hour 30 minutes plus 4 hours brining

### Ingredients

- To Brine the Chicken:
  - 5 cups (1.2L) water
  - 1/2 cup (3 ounces; 85g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use
    half as much by volume or the same weight
  - 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
  - 2 teaspoons red chile flakes
  - 10 bone-in chicken pieces (about 4 pounds/1.8kg total), preferably
    drumsticks and thighs
- For the Flour Dredge:
  - 2 cups (9 ounces; 255g) all-purpose flour
  - 1 1/2 tablespoons (3/4 ounce; 20g) seasoning salt, such as Lawry's
  - 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
  - 1 tablespoon ground white pepper
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons MSG
  - 3/4 teaspoon cayenne
- To Fry:
  - Vegetable or other neutral oil, for frying (about 4 cups/1L)

### Directions

1. To Brine the Chicken: In a very large mixing bowl or vessel, stir together
   water, salt, black pepper, and red chile flakes until salt is dissolved.

1. Add chicken, making sure it is submerged in the brine. Cover with plastic
   and refrigerate for at least 4 and up to 12 hours.

1. For the Flour Dredge: In a medium bowl, whisk together seasoning salt,
   flour, black pepper, white pepper, cumin, curry powder, paprika, MSG, and
   cayenne.

1. Fit a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet. Working with one piece of
   chicken at a time, lift chicken from brine and dip in the flour mixture to
   completely coat, using fingers to press the flour coating onto every nook
   and cranny.

1. Place the dredged chicken on rack and repeat with the remaining chicken
   pieces.

1. To Fry: Line a second baking sheet with a wire rack for the finished fried
   chicken. Fill a large cast iron skillet with about 1 inch oil and heat to
   350°F (175°C) over medium-high heat. Working in batches and being careful
   not to overcrowd the skillet, fry chicken, turning once, until golden brown
   all over and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center (but not
   touching the bone) registers 150°F (65°C) for white meat and 165°F (75°C)
   for dark, about 15 minutes per batch (note that frying times can vary
   depending on the size and shape of the chicken pieces).

1. Transfer fried chicken to the prepared rack and let cool at least 5 minutes
   before serving. Return oil to 350°F (175°C) and repeat with remaining
   chicken.
